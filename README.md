# Android App: Ranking Earthquake 
An android app that uses android studio and BlueStack Emulator 
## Purpose
Used Android Studio to create a mobile app that fetches the earthquake API and displays recent updates on earthquakes based on magnitude or chronological order
## User Interface
When we first open the app, we have a drop down menu when clicking the "order by" button that allow us to select if we want to order earthquake by chronological order or the magnitude of the earthquake.

We also have a clickable calender view, when you click on the "Start date" button, a calender API is loaded. This date is for when we want to start fetching earthquake data. For example, if we click on today's date, it will show if there has been any earthquake recorded today.
